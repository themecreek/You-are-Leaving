# U-Sure
The webmaster will be able to choose what happens when a user clicks a link that causes one to leave the site.

Say for official government sites or corporation that want to put in a final disclaimer or notice before you go from a link found on their site away.

This can be useful to let users know very well that your site is not endorsing or affilating with the links shared on your site.
